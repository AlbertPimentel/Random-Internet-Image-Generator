 *  What is the purpose of this project?
 **********************************************************************/
 This project is intended to be more artful than practical. The primary
 reason for wanting to generate random images of whatever may be on
 the Internet is curiosity, plain and simple. It initially stemmed out
 of my growing interest in HTML and web design. From there I figured
 I could use what I know of HTML to do something interesting.
    
/**********************************************************************
 *  What are these classes, i.e. DrawImages, In.Java, PennDraw.java,
 *  RandomImages.java?
 **********************************************************************/
 PennDraw is present merely for basic drawing functionality. In.java
 allows for simple text file reading. RandomImage is the heart of the
 program, serving as the website generator, HTML parser, and image link
 verifier. DrawImage simply takes in image links from RandomImage and draws
 9 random images on the user's screen.   
 
 TO-DO: Add getters and setters. Optimize image link generation speed.
